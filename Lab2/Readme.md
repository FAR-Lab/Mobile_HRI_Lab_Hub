# Then Prototype the Robot

**Pratul Tandon (pt347), Trevor Morcott (trm75), Maria Teresa Parreira (mb2554)**

### Deliverables for this lab are: 

0. Fill in the questions along the way! 
1. 1 photo of costumed device
2. Reflections on the process
3. Video sketch of 1 prototyped interactions with costumed device
4. Submit the items above in the lab2 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report 

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Provide feedback to your peers](#part-a-provide-feedback)

B) [Site the interaction](#part-b-site-the-interaction)

C) [Costume the robot](#part-c-costume-the-robot)

D) [Wizard the robot](#part-d-wizard-the-robot) 

E) [Video record the interaction](#part-e-record)

## Part A. Provide Feedback

Feedback:
Might be important to think about how the robot may be perceived as dangerous depending on the situation - thinking about guard bot
Similar when they are there feels like they maybe should help (accident bot) - understand it can't but may impact perception if not made clear
Clear what each robot does and the purpose - not entirely what's the interaction with the person
Very impressed with high quality drawings
In the reflections, we would have liked to see more on what worked or didn't work in the videos. For instance, what felt awkward? How did they feel about the interactions?

## Part B. Site the interaction


\*\***Sketch and/or take photos of the site(s) you are considering.**\*\*

SassyBot is a mobile robot stylist. It provides advice and feedback on a fit for clients visiting a store. It can also be used as a personal stylist â€“ so, instead of being store-adjacent, it would be person-adjacent. It takes into account personal preferences and different styles. Its mobility and sensors make it a valuable asset to the shopping experience.

Bloomingdales Fitting Room (on Roosevelt Island) or other clothing stores

\*\***Document the activities being considered.**\*\*

SassyBot provides valuable advice for customers. It can react to customer fits, suggest alternatives, guide the client to the fitting room or across the store. We illustrate our ideas:

\*\***What issues or opportunities arise from the site and activities?**\*\*

Issues:
* How the robot will see the person
* How the robot will avoid other people
* Where the robot will be stowed and interact
* How to shoot and try the scene while respecting those in the store

Opportunities:
* Potentially ask real people
* See what the real dimensions of the room will be
* Explore opportunities to incorporate into existing features like the mirror 

## Part C. Costume the robot

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop one costume so that CloneBot can fit into it's setting.
Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger?
Pick one of the custumes and make it with paper or cardboard or any other material!

\*\***Include sketches of what your robot might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the robot to look?**\*\*

We wanted to convey that the robot was a qualified to comment on their fashion; this is conveyed by the robot itself having good fashion.
The robot had to feel approachable but also upscale and suitable to be found in a luxury store; humaneseque so that humans would feel it is qualified to comment on their clothing items.
Approachable, cute and assertive as it handles sensitive and personal moments / video.

## Part D. Wizard the Robot

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

We worked on the costume and tested the mobility of the robot.

## Part E. Record

\*\***Take videos of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

Videos:

* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bNEm5A9bAg4D4mWtCYiNBxggJiruMrLF/view?usp=sharing
* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T1b1bhXN4YpdWVYOtz7X_f2uslF33JUz/view?usp=sharing -- full interaction, on site

\*\***Please mention anyone else you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*


\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*


Reflection

* On reflection it was very difficult to film in the store. This was due to the fact that the robot got in the way, others did not want a robot near their room while they were changing and the swinging doors would have decapitated Edna if she were not more visible.
* Additionally we noticed how you really wanted to feel seen by the robot and it was annoying if she passed judgment without a good look.  
* It was also frustrating there was no way to interrogate the bots' decisions and ask why or why not they reacted a certain way.
