# Then Prototype the Robot
This week's lab is a continuation of the previous week. We explore the role of both *siting*--the location and activity--in interaction, as well as the *form and appearance* of the robot in the interaction.


## Prep

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors/Utility Knifes
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. **Found objects and materials** -- You will have to costume your CloneBot so that it fits in the intended setting. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative! We have fabric, just ask!
   




### Deliverables for this lab are: 

0. Fill in the questions along the way! 
1. 3 photos of costumed devices
2. Reflections on the process
3. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions with costumed devices
4. Submit the items above in the lab2 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report 
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Provide feedback to your peers](#part-a-provide-feedback)

B) [Site the interaction](#part-b-site-the-interaction)

C) [Costume the robot](#part-c-costume-the-robot)

D) [Wizard the robot](#part-d-wizard-the-robot) 

E) [Video record the interaction](#part-e-record)

Labs are due on Tuesdays before class. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Provide Feedback
You and your teammates will be assigned lab 1 submissions from one other group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear.

https://github.com/jamie-cao/Mobile_HRI_Lab_Hub/blob/main/Lab1/jc2974_Readme.md

1. I like their special effect of the red fire in the video! I saw a fireman who needed to find people trapped in a building on fire (goal) and he asked the robot. The robot guides the fireman successfully to find a dying person. Suggestion & Question: The robot led the fireman to people in a building on fire, but I wonder how the robot actually found the people, and does the robot actually finds the people faster than the fireman? Do the robot find people first and then signal the fireman to come, or does the robot actually lead the way?
2. I guessed the goal of the character is to write songs with more creative beats/resources. The person asked the robot to help him write a good song, but magically the robot wrote a song. Not sure how the robot achieved that? Also, if the robot wrote the song, would the person still own the song?
3. I saw a robot carrying an iphone around showcasing it to people. The person can ask the robot what the iphone is and the robot answers. It seems like the robot wants to advertise the iphone and sell it? It would be more clear if the robot actually has more interactions with the person in the video!


**Summarize feedback your feedback here.**

## Part B. Site the interaction

Think about where the interaction you are prototyping is going to occur-- on a desk? on a floor? indoors? outdoors?

What other people and objects are in that space?

What activities are going on in that space? What activity is the robot going to be involved in?

\*\***Sketch and/or take photos of the site(s) you are considering.**\*\*

The intended interaction of the robot takes place in households that have pets. For the purpose of acting out and recording the interactions, we will do it on a big desk and draw a dog on a cardboard to represent an actual dog. In the meantime, the dog's owner is at another place controlling the robot.

\*\***Document the activities being considered.**\*\*

The activities in the scene include the dog barking, making noises and running in the house. The robot will participate in watching the dog for its owner through the camera as well as playing with the dog.

\*\***What issues or opportunties arise from the site and activities?**\*\*

The issue the robot is trying to solve is to keep the dog company while the owner is away. There is plenty of room for the robot to move around and do different types of interactions such as dancing. However, the robot will also need to take the risk of being hit or accidentally harmed by the dog and other things in the environment.


## Part C. Costume the robot

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that CloneBot can fit into it's setting.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? 

Pick one of the custumes and make it with paper or cardboard or any other material!

\*\***Include sketches of what your robot might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***Include photos of your custumed robot here.**\*\*

We picked "dog companion" to custume:

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the robot to look?**\*\*

Our robot is a pet companion, so the number one goal for us was to make it fun to play with. In order to induce pets’ curiosity and to make them comfortable with the robot’s presence, we decided to make the robot animal-like, in particular, a snail. We cut out a cardboard plane and folded it to create a shell around the robot, with its front plane being the face of the animal. We cut out the mouth area for the camera and stuck two round shaped cardboard pieces onto the plane as eyes. We also made a pink bow using gauze fabric to make the robot more appealing.


## Part D. Wizard the Robot
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the robot while someone interacts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

![10EC7F50-F073-4DA7-B589-9C8583B0D7D9_1_105_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31870235/218568889-d74d1558-7bdf-4b6c-9213-d3a0be14e312.jpeg)

This is our setup: one person holding the cardboard dog on a table, and another person Zooms in and controls the robot.

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.
